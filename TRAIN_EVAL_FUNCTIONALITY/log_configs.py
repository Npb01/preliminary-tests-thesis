#   outcome_determining_activities (axiom 2)
#   Maps each outcome class index to the activity whose LAST occurrence in the
#   suffix implies that outcome. `None` for logs without an outcome head.
#
#   Activity NAMES, not integer ids: the tensor ids are `categ_mapping + 1` and
#   are resolved at runtime by `outcome_consistency_metrics.resolve_determining_ids`.
#   Hardcoding ids would keep "working" silently against a re-preprocessed log
#   with a different vocabulary; names raise KeyError instead.
#
#   Class indices come from the preprocessing scripts
#   (`create_BPIC17_DR_data_multiclass.py`): {'Accepted': 0, 'Canceled': 1,
#   'Refused': 2}. The LAST-occurrence reading is the only exact one -- an
#   any-occurrence reading of O_Accepted holds just 70% of the time, because an
#   accepted offer can still be cancelled afterwards (see `axioms.md`).
