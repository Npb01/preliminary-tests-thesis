"""Outcome / activity-suffix cross-task consistency metrics (axiom 2).

Pure tensor functions, deliberately free of any model or inference-loop state so
they can be unit-tested on synthetic inputs without a GPU. `inference_procedure`
calls `outcome_consistency_diagnostics()`; nothing here imports from SuTraN.

The quantity of interest is the **outcome implied by the predicted activity
suffix**: the LAST activity in the suffix drawn from the determining set
{O_Accepted, O_Cancelled, O_Refused} fixes the case outcome. On BPIC_17_DR that
identity holds exactly (1.000000, zero exceptions over 346,415 train and 172,345
test non-leaky instances) -- see `axioms.md` §"Axiom 2" and HANDOFF §8.7.

Note the *any-occurrence* form is NOT valid and must not be used here:
`O_Accepted in suffix => Accepted` holds only 0.701 of the time, because an
accepted offer can be cancelled later.

These metrics answer the question that gates the whole axiom-2 study (HANDOFF
§8.7): given two routes to the case outcome -- the outcome head, and the decoded
activity suffix -- which is more accurate, and how often do they disagree?
That is the direct analogue of the Sigma-ttne vs RRT comparison for axiom 1, and
the scope condition in HANDOFF §2.3 says the constraint only helps when it pulls
a head toward the *better* estimator.
