Inference utilities for SuTraN+.

Orchestrates validation/test loops for the SuTraN+ Transformer:
batches the inference dataset, invokes the model's autoregressive
`eval()` forward pass to collect activity suffix, timestamp suffix,
remaining runtime (optional), and outcome (optional) predictions, and
forwards them to
`BatchInference` for metric aggregation (instance-based and case-based).

    """Inference loop, both for validation set and ultimate test set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : SuTraN
        The initialized and current version of a SuTraN neural network. 
        Should be set to evaluation mode to trigger the AR decoding loop 
        within SuTraN's forward method. 
    inference_dataset : tuple of torch.Tensor
        Contains the tensors comprising the inference dataset, including 
        the labels for all prediction heads. 
    remaining_runtime_head : bool
        Whether or not the model is also trained to directly predict the 
        remaining runtime given a prefix.
    outcome_bool : bool
        Indicates whether an outcome head (binary or multiclass,
        depending on ``out_type``) was trained and should be evaluated.
        Outcome predictions are generated at the first decoding step
        only and must stay aligned with the preprocessing pipeline
        that produced the labels.
    out_mask : bool
        Whether an instance-level outcome mask is applied to discard
        instances whose inputs (i.e. one of its' prefix events) leak the
        outcome label. When `True`, outcome labels/predictions are subset
        before computing loss and metrics.
    out_type : {None, 'binary_outcome', 'multiclass_outcome'}
        The type of outcome prediction that is being performed in the 
        multi-task setting. Only taken into account of outcome prediction 
        is included in the event log to begin with, and hence if 
        `outcome_bool=True`. If so, `'binary_outcome'` denotes binary 
        outcome (BO) prediction (binary classification), while 
        `'multiclass_outcome'` denotes multi-class outcome (MCO) 
        prediction (Multi-Class classification). 
    num_outclasses : int or None
        The number of outcome classes in case 
        `outcome_bool=True` and `out_type='multiclass_outcome'`. 
    num_categoricals_pref : int
        The number of categorical features (including the activity label) 
        contained within each prefix event token. For the NDA 
        implementation of SuTraN (`SuTraN_no_context`), this parameter 
        should be set to `1`. 
    mean_std_ttne : list of float
        Training mean and standard deviation used to standardize the time 
        till next event (in seconds) target. Needed for re-converting 
        ttne predictions to original scale. Mean is the first entry, 
        std the second.
    mean_std_tsp : list of float
        Training mean and standard deviation used to standardize the time 
        since previous event (in seconds) feature of the decoder suffix 
        tokens. Needed for re-converting time since previous event values 
        to original scale (seconds). Mean is the first entry, std the 2nd.
    mean_std_tss : list of float
        Training mean and standard deviation used to standardize the time 
        since start (in seconds) feature of the decoder suffix tokens. 
        Needed for re-converting time since start to original scale 
        (seconds). Mean is the first entry, std the 2nd. 
    mean_std_rrt : list of float
        List consisting of two floats, the training mean and standard 
        deviation of the remaining runtime labels (in seconds). Needed 
        for de-standardizing remaining runtime predictions and labels, 
        such that the MAE can be expressed in seconds (and minutes). 
    og_caseint : torch.Tensor 
        Tensor of dtype torch.int64 and shape `(N_inf,)`, with `N_inf` 
        the number of instances contained within the inference (test or 
        validation) set. 
        Contains the integer-mapped case IDs of the 
        original inference set cases from which each of the `N_val` 
        instances have been derived. Used for computing the CaLenDiR 
        (weighted) metrics instead of the instance-based metrics. These 
        metrics are used for early stopping and final callback selection. 
    instance_mask_out : {torch.Tensor, None}
        Tensor of dtype torch.bool and shape 
        `(N_val,)`. Containing bool outcome prediction mask, 
        evaluating to True if an instance 
        (/ prefix-suffix pair / prefix) should be masked from 
        contributing to the outcome loss or evaluation metrics because of
        the outcome label being derived from event information already
        contained within the prefix events (that serve as inputs) to the
        multi-task model. By default `None`. If no outcome prediction
        is required (`outcome_bool=False`), or in case outcome
        prediction is required, but the outcome labels are not derived
        directly from information contained in other event data, and 
        hence not contained in part of the `N_val` validation instances' 
        prefixes (model inputs) (`outcome_bool=True` and 
        `out_mask=False`), it should be set to `None`.
    results_path : None or str, optional
        The absolute path name of the folder in which the final 
        evaluation results should be stored. The default of None should 
        be retained for intermediate validation set computations.
    val_batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size for iterating over inference dataset. By default 8192. 

    Returns
    -------
    list
        Instance-based (IB) averages in the order
        `[avg_MAE_ttne_stand, avg_MAE_ttne_minutes, avg_dam_lev, ...]`
        with remaining-runtime and outcome entries appended when the
        corresponding heads are active.
    list
        Case-based (CB) averages in the analogous order.
    list
        `[results_dict_pref, results_dict_suf]`, each mapping prefix
        (or suffix) length to `[avg_dls, avg_rrt_mae_minutes,
        avg_ttne_mae_minutes, count]`.


    Notes
    -----
    Additional explanations commonly referred tensor dimensionalities: 

    * `num_prefs` : the integer number of instances, aka 
        prefix-suffix pairs, contained within the inference dataset 
        for which this `BatchInference` instance is initialized. Also 
        often referred to as `batch_size` in the comment lines 
        complementing the code. 

    * `window_size` : the maximum sequence length of both the prefix 
        event sequences, as well as the generated suffix event 
        predictions. 

    * `num_activities` : the total number of possible activity labels 
        to be predicted. This includes the padding and end token. The 
        padding token will however always be masked, such that it 
        cannot be predicted. Also referred to as `num_classes`.
