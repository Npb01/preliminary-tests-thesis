"""Axiom 2: outcome / activity-suffix consistency as an LTN constraint.

Formulation A from `axioms.md`: the LAST activity in the suffix drawn from the
determining set {O_Accepted, O_Cancelled, O_Refused} fixes the case outcome. That
identity holds exactly in the labels (1.000000 over 346,415 train and 172,345
test non-leaky BPIC_17_DR instances, and exact per class).

Structurally parallel to `ltn_consistency.py` (axiom 1):

    grounding   ordinary tensor code building the term the logic talks about
                -- there, a sum over the ttne suffix; here, the soft
                "last determining activity" distribution q(o)
    predicate   smooth truth degree in [0,1]
    quantifier  ltn Forall with AggregPMeanError(p=2)

Only the last two are LTN operations. The product inside the grounding is not an
ad-hoc trick, though: "a(o) occurs at t AND nothing determining occurs after t"
is a fuzzy conjunction under the PRODUCT T-NORM, where AND is multiplication and
NOT x is 1-x. So

    p_t(a(o)) * prod_{s>t} (1 - d_s)

is that formula evaluated, and q(o) is the fuzzy existential over t.

WHY NOT ANY-OCCURRENCE
----------------------
`O_Accepted in suffix => Accepted` holds only 0.701 of the time -- an accepted
offer can still be cancelled later, and 43.9% of Canceled cases contain both
activities. Only the last occurrence is exact. The one-directional alternative
(formulation B) additionally has a degenerate solution: predicting all three
determining activities in every suffix satisfies it for any outcome at no cost.

NUMERICS
--------
The product is computed directly, not in log space. With ~1.2 determining
activities per suffix, prod(1-d_s) ~ exp(-1.2) ~ 0.30 -- some forty orders of
magnitude above float32 underflow. `min_survival` is returned so this assumption
can be monitored rather than assumed; switch to log space only if it ever
approaches ~1e-6.
